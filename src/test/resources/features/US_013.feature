Feature: Management of Pages' functionality in the navbar
  As an admin,
  I would like to add, edit and delete the items in each page
  so that, we can configure each page's details more efficiently for the school management.

  Background:
    Given I am logged in as an admin in the dashboard

  Scenario Outline: Manage an item in its belonging page

    Given I've navigated to <page>
    When I add a new item with following credentials:
      | <add_fields> |
    Then the result message should contain 'successfully created'

    When I update the item with following credentials:
      | <edit_fields> |
    Then the result message should contain 'successfully updated'

    When I delete the item
    Then the result message should contain 'successfully deleted'
